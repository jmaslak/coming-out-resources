This was sent by my manager who introduces the topic:


Team,

Over the past month <deadname> and I have been working with HR on the following announcement. This is an important event
for <deadname> as you will understand as you read below. I am sure <deadname> will receive the full support of this team.

From <deadname>:

“Dear Colleagues,

For over two decades, I have sent and received dozens of emails every workday. I have never agonized over, rewritten, and
edited an email as much as this one, so please bear with me here.

With that disclaimer out of the way, I will start by being direct: I am a not who you probably think I am, at least not in
some ways. You see, I am a transgender woman. My professional life is the last remaining sphere of my life where I present
myself as a man. Outside of work, I live and interact with society as a woman. In fact, I have legally changed my name and
gender.

I am <new full name>.

It is now time for me to be <new name> at work as well. With this email, I will be <new name> in all aspects of my life.
“<deadname>” no longer exists.

As part of my workplace transition plan, I will be working from home tomorrow (March 9th) and Monday (March 12th). I will
return to the <location> office on Tuesday, March 13th.  While I expect you will be able to recognize me, you will notice
some changes to my appearance, particularly how I groom and dress.

You may be familiar with reality TV shows where transgender people seemingly undergo an immediate and dramatic change.
Reality (the non-TV kind) is usually far slower and less dramatic. Please keep this in mind when you see me on the
<location> campus Tuesday!

I am asking you to use my true, legal, and correct name: <new name> (pronounced <pronounciation>, rhythming with <word>).
If you have any questions about the pronunciation, please feel free to ask!  I am also asking you to use pronouns
appropriate for my gender, as you would for any other woman.  For me, the correct pronouns are “she,” “her,” and “hers.”

I realize that some people may find this change difficult. It is challenging to change any habit, such as the name and
pronouns you use for me. I do not expect perfection, and I will not think poorly of anyone making an effort when they
occasionally slip up on the name or pronouns. However, I may correct someone when they use the wrong name or pronoun.
Please do not take offense if this happens to you! The best way to handle such a mistake is to say, “I am sorry, <first
name>,” and to move on in the conversation.

I desire to minimize any disruption at work. I enjoy my role in <group>, and I want to continue to work alongside
all of you. I am excited to come to work fully as myself, fully able to focus on my role on our team.  I am appreciative
of the help of that HR and my manager, <manager name>, have provided throughout this process, and I believe that thanks
to their support, this transition will be a smooth one.

In line with this, my old email address will remain active as an alias, although my primary address will be updated to
match my name.  Likewise, my Skype name and information will also be updated, but my phone number will remain the same
(<phone>).  It may take a few days for IT to update their records.

While I think this email will be sufficient to understand what is most essential, I know that you may have a natura
curiosity about this process.  I have prepared a longer document that has more details about my transition:

I also know that you may have some questions - I am happy to answer most questions. While I will not answer questions
about specific medical procedures, I am otherwise very open about the process and journey that I am on. I am also
unlikely to be offended by your questions, so please don’t feel you have to avoid this topic with me!  In fact, I am
excited to be myself in all areas of my life, finally!  Please feel free to stop by my cube when I am back in the
office if you want to say hi – I am at <cube location> (my cube is alongside the windows in building <number> that
face building <number>).

Sincerely,

<new name> – formerly (and no more) <deadname>.”
